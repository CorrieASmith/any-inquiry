<p>Thank you for clicking the contact page. If you're reading this, that means I'm not as bad at routing as I thought I was. If you have a comment or a question, you can use the resources below to submit that. Although I can't promise that I won't judge you for submitting a question on this page rather than on the questions page. This is, after all, a Q&A forum. You uncultured swine.</p>
